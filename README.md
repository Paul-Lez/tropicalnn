### Tropical NN

This repository countains some code for a project on tropical geometry and neural networks. The content is organised as follows:
- General purpose code (e.g. the computational framework for Puiseux rational functions, etc) goes in `src`
- Code for running the paper's experiments goes in `paper/experiments` 
- Code for generating e.g. plots of our data and other paper specific tools should go in `paper/tools`
- The experimental outputs and data that will be used in the paper should be put in `paper/experimental_outcomes`
- Other pieces of data generated by experiments/used for experiments should go in `data`
- Code used for testing should go in `tests`

How to run the experiemnts: 
- Symbolic computations of linear regions of neural networks (section 5.2). Run file `experiment_launchers/experiment_5_2_symbolic.jl` in Julia using `julia experiment_launchers/experiment_5_2_symbolic.jl`.
- Numerical computation of linear regions of neural networks (section 5.2). Run the Jupyter notebook `experiment_launchers/deep_set_experiments.ipynb`.
- Linear regions for rational functions (section 5.1). Run `experiment_5_1_1.jl` (computation for 3 variables) and `experiment_5_1_2.jl` (computation for 4 variables) in Julia using `julia experiment_launchers/experiment_5_1_1.jl` and `julia experiment_launchers/experiment_5_1_1.jl`.
