### Tropical NN

This repository countains some code for a project on tropical geometry and neural networks. The content is organised as follows:
- General purpose code (e.g. the computational framework for Puiseux rational functions, etc) goes in `src`
- Code for running the paper's experiments goes in `paper/experiments` 
- Code for generating e.g. plots of our data and other paper specific tools should go in `paper/tools`
- The experimental outputs and data that will be used in the paper should be put in `paper/experimental_outcomes`
- Other pieces of data generated by experiments/used for experiments should go in `data`
- Code used for testing should go in `tests`
